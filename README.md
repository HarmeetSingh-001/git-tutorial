# git-tutorial

For this html website, I utilized 3 sources.
The blackboard lectures for a reminder on some of the course that wasn't HTML or CSS related.
I used the HTML and CSS lectures for finding how to code certain aspects of the website.
The final source was https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp which helped with tabs and how to code them with the CSS.
